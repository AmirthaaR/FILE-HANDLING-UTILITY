# DESCRIPTION ABOUT MY PROJECT 

This Java program is a simple console-based file handling application that allows users to write, read, and modify the contents of a text file named data.txt. It uses core Java classes like File, FileWriter, and Scanner for performing file operations.

The program starts with a menu-driven interface inside a loop, giving the user four options:

Write to file – Overwrites existing content with new user input.

Read from file – Displays the current content of the file.

Modify file – Replaces all occurrences of a specific word with a new word.

Exit – Ends the program.

The writeToFile method collects user input until "exit" is typed and saves it to the file. readFromFile reads and prints the file content line by line. modifyFile performs a search-and-replace operation using the user's input.

Error handling is included to catch and display file-related issues. Overall, the program is a beginner-friendly example of file manipulation in Java, demonstrating practical use of file streams, string replacement, and basic user interaction.
